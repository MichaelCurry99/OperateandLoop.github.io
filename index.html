<h1> Operating a Loop and Iteration</h1>

<h2> What is the Loop and Iteration? </h2>

<h3><p> There is much to do when it comes to JavaScripting the certain codes to perform certain things. Using a Loop is a
    new thing for me at the moment. When, having to start a Loop, you'd have to look very carefully into what you're doing. Make sure
    that the variables and code names are in the correct format. For example, using the loop system to make it execute to the desired
    effect, it would have to be "true" or "false".</p>

    <p>  Using the "while" feature, you can initiate a loop as well as using "do...while" to do a another type of execution. I'm not
    completely on board of what these functions, expressions, and iterations can do, but I will try my best to grasp it. This just lets
    me know that I have to read more into what these are. I feel like I know the basics of HTML and CSS, though JavaScript hasn't been brought
    to my attention as much. Now I must get back to studying the process of JavaScript!
